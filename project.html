                <p id="quote">“When the climate changes, our community changes. And if we do not change with our climate, ​our culture has the potential to be lost. ​We must accept and adapt to climate change to sustain our Dënësułinë values.”​</p>
                <p id="quote-sub">- Dënë Cheecham-Uhrich, ​a climate activist and forest-water champion from the Clearwater River Dënë First Nation ​in La Loche, Saskatchewan.</p>
                
                <p>We are working together on an ​Environment Canada and Climate Change funded project, “Enhancing Climate Literacy: ​A Collective Climate Accountability and Adaptation Project (CCAAP)".  Our focus is on Canada’s boreal forest, ​home for many Indigenous communities.​</p>
                
                <p>The Dënësułinë people’s culture reflects their intricate knowledge of the relationships among the forest, the water and their people.​ As land and water changed, they observed and adapted to these changes. ​The boreal landscape has undergone substantial natural resource extraction activities, making Indigenous communities concerned for their health and well-being. Multiple stressors associated with climate change ​are fundamentally changing the forest-water nexus.​</p>

                <p>Temperatures are increasing.​ The highest concentration of uranium for nuclear energy – one of Canada’s solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – is in the western boreal forest. An increase in fire activity ​– “more area burning, more fires burning, a much longer fire season” – ​is accelerating the changes to the boreal forest. ​(Lynn Johnston, forest fire research specialist at the Canadian Forest Service). Browning and falling trees are the direct result of climate change​ (Barry Cooke, research specialist at the Canadian Forest Service).</p>

                <p id="quote">"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples has contributed little to climate change, yet they are the most adversely affected by it."</p>
                <p id="quote-sub">- Gita Cosentino, Indigenous Peoples Advisory Consultant, World Bank.</p>
            
                <p>The Canadian government entered into treaties with Indigenous peoples.​ However, the Indigenous people were ​not equal partners in these treaties.​ Despite their earlier history, ​some Indigenous leaders want to contribute as equal partners to Canada’s responsibility to lead on climate action.​</p>

                <p>Our goal is to create a new generation of climate leaders.​</p>

                <h1>PROJECT PHASES</h1> 
                <h2 id="project-h2">1) Climate Literacy​</h2> 
                <p>We are exploring if there is a common language between Indigenous knowledge and conventional science, or if can be integrated into unrealized knowledge.​</p>
                
                <h2 id="project-h2">2) Climate Science</h2>
                <p>We are working to advance our understanding of the inextricable linkages of the forest-water nexus and the people that depend on them.​</p>

                <h2 id="project-h2">3) Climate Action and Adaptation</h2>
                <p>We are helping communities slow down the rate of climate change, while adapting to the new forest-water nexus. Managing the forest-water nexus can lead to improved community well-being.​</p>
