                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>Indigenous communities are often left behind in systemic climate action, their voices and natural databases (Indigenous/Traditional/Local knowledge systems) overlooked. They are marginalized despite their cultural dynamics and substantial dependence on subsistence living resources being deeply impacted by climate change. We aim to establish Indigenous communities as equal treaty partners in Canadaâ€™s decolonial transition to a low-carbon future and sustainable society.</p>

                <h1>OUR PROJECT</h1>
                <p>Beading A New World: Collective Climate Accountability and Adaptation Project is a community-driven climate action project. We have gathered experts in Northern social, ecological and interdisciplinary science systems as well as experts in DÃ«nÃ«suÅ‚inÃ« traditional knowledge systems and language to guide and enhance our project and its reciprocal research.</p>
                <p>Our â€˜Beading A New Worldâ€™ team has proactively engaged and interacted with CRDN community leaders, treaty partners, youth and Elders. We have initiated constructive and cultural-climate change inclusive dialogue, following CRDNâ€™s DÃ«nÃ«suÅ‚inÃ« language and culture guidelines for researchers.</p>
